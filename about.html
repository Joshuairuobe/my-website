            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Harvest Havens began with a simple idea: to share the joy of growing and harvesting your own food. It all started with a small garden in the backyard of our founder, who wanted to teach others how to grow their own sustainable food. Over time, our passion for sustainability and healthy eating grew, leading us to create this platform where anyone can learn, shop, and thrive with the harvest.</p>
